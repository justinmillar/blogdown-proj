abstract = "There is a need for comprehensive evaluations of the underlying local factors that contribute to residual malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. However, it is difficult to compare the wide array of demographic, socio-economic, and environmental variables associated with malaria transmission using standard statistical approaches while accounting for seasonal differences and nonlinear relationships. This article uses a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach for identifying and comparing potential risk and protective factors associated with residual malaria."
